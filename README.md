# Project 2 - Algorithms and Programming 3: **AlgoStar**

Project number 2 for the subject _Algorithms and Programming 3_ [75.07 - 95.02] at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Buenos Aires (FIUBA).

The documentation, variable names and functions names are mostly written in Spanish as it is the language the course is teached on.

## Brief summary

This project consists of developing a turn-based game inspired by the famous video game Starcraft (hence the name Algo (Algorithms) - Star (Starcraft)). The game focuses on the war between empires, the clever use of strategy, and it is based on the construction and management of an empire. It consists of an OOP class model, sounds and a graphical interface, accompanied by a suite of unit and integration tests (game use cases). The implementation was written in the statically typed programming language Java, version 11.0.7. For the development of the solution model, object-oriented programming principles were applied and we worked with TDD (Test Driven Development) and CI (Continuous Integration) techniques, design patterns were also applied where deemed appropriate to solve a specific problem.
